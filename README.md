# Homework 1: Excel Pivot Table 101
Part 1: I used the rows and values fields of the Pivot Table to find budget by title, used the filters to narrow my table to English films in Japan, and added a Grand Total for the rows in the design tab to find the aggregate budget for films meeting the specified criteria. I also formatted the table values as dollar amounts. As can be seen, this aggregate budget is $154,000,000.
