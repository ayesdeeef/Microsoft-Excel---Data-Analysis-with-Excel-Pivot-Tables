# Microsoft-Excel---Data-Analysis-with-Excel-Pivot-Tables
Homework assignments for the Udemy course on Pivot Tables in Microsoft Excel by Chris, the Founder of Maven Analytics. These assignments are completed entirely by myself without the assistance of others and without looking at any solutions available online. The explanations below are all written entirely by myself as well.

# Homework 1: Excel Pivot Table 101
Part 1: I used the rows and values fields of the Pivot Table to find budget by title, used the filters to narrow my table to English films in Japan, and added a Grand Total for the rows in the design tab to find the aggregate budget for films meeting the specified criteria. I also formatted the table values as dollar amounts with no decimal places using number format. Using the resulting pivot table, I can see that the aggregate budget for English films in Japan in the IMDb database is $154,000,000.

Part 2: I cleared the language filter and switched the country of interest from Japan to Denmark. I added a sum of gross revenue value to my values field and reformatted it as a currency with no decimal places. I also changed its column label from 'Sum of Gross Revenue' to 'Gross Revenue ', using a space at the end of the column in order to be able to reuse the label already entered in the pivot table. Using this view, I can determine that the gross revenue for the Danish film 'The Celebration' is $1,647,780.
