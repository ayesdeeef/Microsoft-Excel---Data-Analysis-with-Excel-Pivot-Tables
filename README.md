# Microsoft-Excel---Data-Analysis-with-Excel-Pivot-Tables
This portfolio contains my homework assignments for the Udemy course on Pivot Tables in Microsoft Excel by Chris, the Founder of Maven Analytics. I have completed these assignments entirely by myself without the assistance of others and without looking at any solutions available online. I have also written the explanations below entirely by myself to demonstrate my comprehension of what I am doing. Each homework below is associated with a folder in Github, and each part within each homework below is associated with an excel file within the corresponding folder in Github. To see what I have done in any part, read the part in the ReadMe to see the actions I took on the IMDb Movie Database, and then check the corresponding Excel file to see the pivot table view that resulted after those actions were taken. I have also made the original IMDb Movie Database available in the main folder.

# Homework 1: Excel Pivot Table 101
Part 1: I used the rows and values fields of the Pivot Table to find budget by title, used the filters to narrow my table to English films in Japan, and added a Grand Total for the rows in the design tab to find the aggregate budget for films meeting the specified criteria. I also formatted the table values as dollar amounts with no decimal places using number format. Using the resulting pivot table, I can see that the aggregate budget for English films in Japan in the IMDb database is $154,000,000.

Part 2: I cleared the language filter and switched the country of interest from Japan to Denmark. I added a sum of gross revenue value to my values field and reformatted it as a currency with no decimal places. I also changed its column label from 'Sum of Gross Revenue' to 'Gross Revenue ', using a space at the end of the column in order to be able to reuse the label already entered in the pivot table. Using this view, I can determine that the gross revenue for the Danish film 'The Celebration' is $1,647,780.
