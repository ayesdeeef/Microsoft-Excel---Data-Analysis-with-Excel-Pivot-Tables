Homework assignments for the Udemy course on Pivot Tables in Microsoft Excel by Chris, the Founder of Maven Analytics. These assignments are completed entirely by myself without the assistance of others and without looking at any solutions available online. The explanations below are all written entirely by myself as well.

# Homework 1: Excel Pivot Table 101
Part 1: I used the rows and values fields of the Pivot Table to find budget by title, used the filters to narrow my table to English films in Japan, and added a Grand Total for the rows in the design tab to find the aggregate budget for films meeting the specified criteria. I also formatted the table values as dollar amounts with no decimal places using number format. As can be seen from the resulting pivot table, the aggregate budget for English films in Japan in the IMDb database is $154,000,000.
